# PyInk NLP-Based Spelling Corrector [Proof-of-Concept]
#### Built with PyQT6 and PyDracula Framework

PyInk reflects my passion for Artificial Intelligence, nurtured during my AI coursework. This project serves a dual purpose: demonstrating a solid grasp of NLP concepts and delivering practical value. In the realm of written communication, spelling errors are all too common. While traditional spell-checkers provide basic fixes, they struggle with the complexities of language. This issue intrigued me and prompted me to explore NLP techniques, leading to the creation of PyInk—a more advanced tool for spelling correction.

## Motivation

My drive to develop PyInk arose from a desire to bridge theory and practice in AI. PyInk not only deepened my understanding of NLP but also aimed to help users improve their written communication. The limitations of standard spell-checkers highlighted the need for a smarter solution.

## Key Objectives

- **NLP Integration:** PyInk is built on NLP principles, applied to spelling correction.
- **Accurate Fixes:** Moving beyond simple checks, PyInk aims to understand language nuances for precise corrections.
- **User-Friendly:** Created using PyQT6 and adorned with the pleasing PyDracula theme, PyInk prioritizes user experience.
- **Real-World Impact:** PyInk is more than academia—it's about enhancing communication in the AI era.

While PyInk doesn't yet understand context, it's a step towards smarter communication. Through this project, I contribute to AI-driven language tools while refining my AI and software development skills. PyInk embodies my AI journey, showcasing my commitment to innovative and practical AI applications.
