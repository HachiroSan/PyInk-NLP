# PyInk: NLP-Based Spelling Corrector 
#### Created with PyQT6 and PyDracula Framework

PyInk reflects my interest in Artificial Intelligence developed through my AI coursework. This project has a dual purpose: to show my understanding of NLP concepts and to be practically useful. Spelling mistakes are common in writing. Regular spell-checkers fix simple errors but struggle with complex language. This challenge intrigued me, and it pushed me to explore NLP techniques, resulting in PyInkâ€”a smarter tool for fixing spelling.

## Motivation

I wanted to connect AI theory with real-world use. PyInk helped me learn more about NLP and aimed to make writing better for people. Traditional spell-checkers have limits, and I wanted to build a better solution.

## Goals

- **Using NLP:** PyInk uses NLP ideas to fix spelling.
- **Better Fixes:** Beyond basic checks, PyInk tries to understand language for better corrections.
- **User-Friendly:** Made with PyQT6 and styled with PyDracula, PyInk is easy to use.

Though PyInk doesn't fully get context yet, it's a step toward smarter communication. With this project, I learned about NLP and got better at making software. PyInk shows how AI can help people write better in practical ways.
